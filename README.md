# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict medical insurance costs based on various features such as age, BMI, smoking habits, and other demographic information. It utilizes machine learning techniques, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Regression models, and Random Forest.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Dataset
The dataset used contains information about patients, including:
- Age
- BMI
- Number of Children
- Smoking Status
- Region
- Medical Expenses (Target Variable)

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/medical-insurance-cost-prediction.git
   cd medical-insurance-cost-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open `ML_Project.ipynb` and run the cells.

## Model Training & Evaluation
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.
- **Model Selection:** Implementing SVM, Regression, and Random Forest models.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluating models using RMSE, RÂ² score, and visualization techniques.

## Results & Insights
- The best-performing model is determined based on accuracy and error metrics.
- Feature importance analysis reveals key factors affecting medical expenses.
